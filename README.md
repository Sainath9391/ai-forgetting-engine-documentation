## 🧠 About the Project
This AI-Powered Forgetting Engine simulates human memory decay:
- Cognitive decay over time
- Emotional salience: memories with stronger emotional context persist longer
- Selective retention: keeps high-importance data, forgets trivial details

Instead of endlessly accumulating data like traditional AI, this engine models:
- Ebbinghaus forgetting curves
- Human-like reconstruction biases
- Emotional & contextual salience scoring

---

## 🌟 Motivation & Vision
Today's AI systems remember everything, risking privacy, bias, and inefficiency.
This project aims to:
- Bring AI memory closer to human realism
- Improve AI alignment by letting systems adapt to changing goals & ethics
- Respect data minimization & privacy (e.g., GDPR compliance)

Ultimately, build AI that **learns to forget by design**, making it safer and more relatable.

## ✨ Key Features
✅ Memory decay algorithms based on cognitive psychology  
✅ Emotional/contextual salience scoring (NLP-based)  
✅ Probabilistic recall & memory reconstruction  
✅ Selective retention to keep system lean  
✅ Modular & extensible design, ready to integrate with chatbots, personal assistants, or data systems

## 🏗 Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](assets/architecture_diagram.png)

**Flow:**
1. Data input → Memory Encoder → extract features & emotional/contextual salience
2. Forgetting Engine Core → applies decay, filters memories
3. Memory Store → keeps evolving set of memories
4. Memory Retriever → probabilistically recalls and reconstructs memories
5. Output layer → feeds realistic, imperfect memories to downstream applications

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### 📉 Memory Decay
Exponential decay: `score = initial_score * e^(-λ * age)`

### 🧪 Emotional Salience
Uses NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to detect:
- Sentiment strength
- Keywords importance
- Contextual relevance

### 🧠 Selective Retention
Top-K algorithm keeps most relevant memories, discards low-value ones.

### 🧩 Probabilistic Recall
Adds controlled randomness → recall is human-like, sometimes incomplete or distorted.

## 📦 Applications & Business Value
| Area | Value |
|-----|------|
| AI alignment | Adapt to new ethics, forget outdated harmful data |
| Personal assistants | Forget old reminders gracefully, act human-like |
| Mental health modeling | Simulate memory distortion (PTSD, depression) |
| Creative AI | Characters with flawed, realistic memories |
| Privacy-first AI | Comply with data minimization by design |
| Data pruning | Reduce memory/data storage cost while keeping critical info |

---

## 🧪 Example MVP
- Python-based CLI or web app
- Stores memory objects (`Memory` class)
- Periodic decay
- Emotional salience detection with Hugging Face models
- Probabilistic recall
- Visualizes memory decay over time

## 🚀 Future Improvements & Research Directions
✅ **Multimodal memory:** apply forgetting to images, voice, videos  
✅ **Neural symbolic memory:** combine structured & unstructured memory  
✅ **Reinforcement learning:** dynamically adjust forgetting based on new goals  
✅ **Dynamic privacy tuning:** user-controllable forgetting threshold  
✅ **Bias & fairness mitigation:** forget biased historical data  
✅ **Graph memory models:** store memories as connected events/nodes  
✅ **Explainable AI:** visualize why certain memories were kept/forgotten  
✅ **Scalable vector DB integration:** support millions of memories with FAISS / Pinecone  
✅ **Memory reconstruction networks:** deep learning models to simulate human recall distortions  
✅ **Cloud deployment & API:** offer forgetting-as-a-service for enterprises

> These show a vision to scale this from academic prototype → enterprise-grade AI system.
